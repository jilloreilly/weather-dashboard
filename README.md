# Weather Dashboard

Challenge 8 - A weather dashboard which displays the current weather and 5-day forecast of a given location 

## Description

This weather dashboard showcases the jQuery, JavaScript, 3rd party API, Bootstrap, CSS & HTML skills I have gained from Module 8 (Server APIs) of the Front-end Web Development Bootcamp. 

This weather dashboard will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by **Bootstrap**, **jQuery**, **Day.js** and data from the [**Open Weather Map API**](https://openweathermap.org/api) and [**Pixabay API**](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/)

## Usage

1. The **Weather Dashboard** can be accessed online on Github pages: [https://jilloreilly.github.io/weather-dashboard/](https://jilloreilly.github.io/weather-dashboard/) and the repo can be found: [https://github.com/jilloreilly/weather-dashboard](https://github.com/jilloreilly/weather-dashboard)

2. The user can enter a location in the search form

3. The current weather for the given location (Name, date, weather icon, temperature(Â°C), wind speed(kph) and humidity(%)) is displayed as well as the 5-day forecast (Weather data provided by Open Weather Map API). The background image will display an image from the searched location. (Image provided by Pixabay API).

4. When a new location is entered, the current weather and 5-day forecast will be displayed. A button will appear in the search history underneath the search form

5. The search history for previously searched locations are displayed beneath the search form. Clicking on these buttons will reload the weather data for that location

6. The search history is saved to localstorage, thus on page load, the search history will be displayed on the page.
